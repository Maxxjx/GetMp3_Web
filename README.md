## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd GetMp3
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  Activate the virtual environment:

    -   On Linux/macOS:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    -   On Windows:

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

3.  Drag and drop a video file into the designated area, or use the file input to select a video.

4.  Wait for the upload and processing to complete. A progress bar will indicate the progress.

5.  Once processing is finished, the "Download" button will be enabled. Click it to download the extracted MP3 audio file.  The filename will be based on the original video's filename.

## Notes

-   The application uses temporary file storage for processing, ensuring no files are permanently stored on the server.
-   CORS is enabled to allow requests from different origins.
-   The [robots.txt](http://_vscodecontentref_/8) file disallows crawling of the [uploads](http://_vscodecontentref_/9) directory.
